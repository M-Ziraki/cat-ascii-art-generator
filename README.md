# Cat Ascii Art Generator

## Overview

The **Cat Ascii Art Generator** is a simple web application that displays ASCII cat art randomly. The application features a "Generate" button that, when clicked, shows a new cat ASCII art on the screen. Additionally, it includes a "Copy" button that allows users to copy the displayed art to their clipboard easily.

## Features

- **Random Cat Art Display**: The application showcases a variety of ASCII cat arts. Upon clicking the "Generate" button, a new piece of art is randomly selected from a predefined list and displayed on the screen.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: The "Copy" button copies the current cat art to the user's clipboard, allowing them to paste it anywhere they like.

## Usage

1. **Generate Cat Art**:
   - Click the "Generate" button to display a random piece of ASCII cat art.
   - The displayed art will change every time you click the button.

2. **Copy Cat Art**:
   - Once you find an art piece you like, click the "Copy" button.
   - A confirmation alert will appear, indicating that the art has been copied to your clipboard.
   - You can then paste the copied art anywhere using the standard paste functionality (Ctrl+V on Windows/Linux, Cmd+V on Mac).

## How It Works

The application is built using basic web technologies:

- **HTML**: Structures the web page, including the buttons and the area where the cat art is displayed.
- **CSS**: Provides simple styling for the text and buttons, ensuring a clean and user-friendly interface.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the core functionality:
  - Stores an array of cat ASCII arts.
  - Selects and displays a random art from the array when the "Generate" button is clicked.
  - Copies the displayed art to the clipboard when the "Copy" button is clicked.
